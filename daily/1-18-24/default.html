    OWWWWWWWW.....
    <br>i got my face lasered witha  laser to remove the hair from my face. <br>
    <ol>
        <li>it didnt even do anything</li>
        <li>it hurt so fucking bad like really bad</li>
        <li>it was expensive in parenthasis mom and dad money</li>
    </ol>
    <br>
    besides everything it will probably be worth it but god damn nothing could have prepared me 
    <br>
    it was like if a ghost hand had reached into your flesh, located all of your hair, and ripped them out just slow enough for it to hurt.
    and did that like a million times.
