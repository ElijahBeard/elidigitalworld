    sooooooooo today was a mess. its okay though it happens sometimes... 
    <br>
    I didnt sleep at all last night so i as up all night just rummaging and working on this website.
    <br>I think i have a dr appointment therapyt later this week.
    <br> <br>
    Here are some photos I took from this mornings walk when I got tired of being inside: <br>
    <div class="gallery">
        <img src="./DSC01989.JPG" alt="">
        <img src="./DSC01990.JPG" alt="">
        <img src="./DSC01991.JPG" alt="">
    </div>
    I still dont know how long im going to be able to do this <br>
    Im also not sure if i like this current styling and i wonder how long it will take me to get to the place I want to be.
    <br> I also wonder what that will look like. Will I get used to writing all my journals in an IDE?
