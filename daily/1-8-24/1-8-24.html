    <h1>h1</h1>
    <h2>h2</h2>
    <h3>h3</h3>
    this is the first page. its gonna contain text.
    <br>
    Ill have to get used to using "br" for line spacing 
    unless theres a better way 
    <h4>but</h4> im pretty comfortable with most stylings.
    <br>
    we will spice it up.... in a second here.
    <br>
    <br>
    theres a few spaces. and here is an image: <br>
    <img width="200px" src="/daily/1-8-24/109232.png">
    <br>
    and now we are over the image.
    <br>
    I dont think i have to be so formulaic about how i write these as its more likely ill continue if im not.
    so it will likely just look like this and we can publish the directory every week or something
    <br> <br>or whenever i feel like it.
